## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system implements specialized construction industry estimate comparison and analysis logic through five core components:

## Core Business Components

1. Estimate Comparison Engine
- Primary business logic for construction estimate analysis
- Implements industry-specific comparison thresholds (25% quantities, 15% unit prices)
- Located at `/lib/estimate-comparison.ts`
- Importance: 90/100

2. Construction Estimate Parser
- Specialized parsing for Xactimate/Symbility formats
- Normalizes construction terminology and measurements
- Located at `/lib/estimate-parser.ts`
- Importance: 85/100

3. AI-Enhanced Analysis System
- Construction-specific AI workflow for estimate comparison
- Prioritizes discrepancies based on industry thresholds
- Located at `/tools/estimate-comparison/index.tsx`
- Importance: 80/100

4. Industry-Specific PDF Generation
- Construction-formatted comparison reports
- Specialized sections for measurements and cost differences
- Located at `/lib/pdf-generator.ts`
- Importance: 75/100

5. Construction Role Management
- Industry-specific roles (Super Admin, Owner, Manager, Employee)
- Estimate approval workflows
- Located at `/lib/auth.ts`
- Importance: 70/100

## Integration Architecture

The system employs a subdomain-based tool routing system for access control:
- Tool-specific subdomain mapping
- Validation of subdomain-tool relationships
- Environment-specific routing rules
- Located at `/middleware.ts`
- Importance: 75/100
