# estimate-parsing-flow

The estimate parsing system consists of specialized construction industry workflows:

1. PDF Estimate Ingestion
Path: lib/estimate-parser.ts
- Extracts structured data from construction estimates
- Recognizes Xactimate and Symbility specific formats
- Normalizes construction terminology and measurements
- Maps line items to standardized construction codes
Importance Score: 90/100

2. Xactimate Code Processing
Path: lib/xactimate-lookup.ts
- Validates construction industry standard Xactimate codes
- Maintains mapping of codes to standardized descriptions
- Handles unit conversion for construction measurements
- Normalizes material and labor components
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Terminology Normalization Engine
Path: lib/estimate-comparison/normalize.ts
- Standardizes construction material descriptions
- Handles common industry abbreviations and variants
- Maps equivalent terms across estimate sources
- Maintains construction-specific synonym database
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Construction Item Matching
Path: lib/estimate-comparison/matcher.ts
- Implements specialized algorithms for matching similar line items
- Considers construction code hierarchies
- Handles partial matches based on material specifications
- Analyzes price and quantity variations
Importance Score: 95/100

Core Domain Rules:
- Construction codes must follow Xactimate format
- Material descriptions require standardization to industry terms
- Quantities must be converted to standard construction units
- Line items require matching across multiple estimate sources
