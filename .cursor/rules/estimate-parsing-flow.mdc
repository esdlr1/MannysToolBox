# estimate-parsing-flow

## Core Parsing Components

### Estimate Parser
Path: lib/estimate-parser.ts
- Custom construction terminology normalization
- Industry-specific measurement standardization
- Structured parsing of estimate formats
- Construction material and labor cost extraction

### Comparison Engine 
Path: lib/estimate-comparison.ts
- Line item matching using domain-specific similarity scoring
- Discrepancy detection for measurements and quantities
- Critical vs minor difference classification
- Construction-specific unit conversion handling

## Business Rules

### Terminology Matching
- Normalizes variant terms for identical construction items
- Handles industry abbreviations and standard nomenclature
- Maps equivalent materials across different vendor catalogs

### Cost Analysis
- Identifies pricing discrepancies beyond threshold percentages
- Validates unit price consistency across similar items
- Flags unusual cost variations for manual review

### Measurement Processing
- Standardizes measurements to common units
- Validates quantity calculations
- Detects measurement format inconsistencies

Importance Score: 85/100
- Critical business functionality for estimate comparison
- Complex domain-specific matching algorithms
- Construction industry terminology handling
- Essential for cost control and bid analysis
