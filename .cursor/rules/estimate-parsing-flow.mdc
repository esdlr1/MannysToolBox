# estimate-parsing-flow

Core estimate parsing system implementing construction-specific document analysis and data extraction:

1. PDF Parsing Engine (Importance: 95/100)
- Intelligent extraction of line items from construction estimates
- Format detection for multiple estimate types (Xactimate, Symbility)
- Recovery mechanisms for partial data extraction
- Pattern matching for construction industry terminology

2. Terminology Normalization (Importance: 90/100) 
- Standardization of construction terms and measurements
- Synonym mapping for common material descriptions
- Unit conversion and standardization (LF, SF, EA)
- Trade-specific terminology handling

3. Construction Item Matching (Importance: 85/100)
- Advanced matching algorithm for line items across different estimate formats
- Token-aware processing with dynamic truncation
- Construction-specific matching rules
- Intelligent handling of industry terminology variations

Key Business Rules:
1. Line Item Structure
- Code validation against Xactimate standard
- Required fields: quantity, unit price, description
- Optional fields: notes, room location, category

2. Matching Hierarchy
- Exact code match (highest priority)
- Normalized description match
- Similar item detection with trade context
- Partial matches requiring review

3. Data Validation
- Trade-specific validation rules
- Material and labor component separation
- Required vs optional item classification
- Cross-reference with construction dependencies
