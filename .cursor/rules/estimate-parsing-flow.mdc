# estimate-parsing-flow

Importance Score: 90/100

The estimate parsing system implements specialized construction industry logic for processing and normalizing estimate documents:

Core Components:

1. Terminology Normalization
- Implements construction-specific matching rules
- Maps common variations like "R&R" to "Remove and Replace"
- Handles industry standard abbreviations and alternates
- Normalizes room names and location descriptors

2. Line Item Matching Engine
Location: app/api/tools/estimate-comparison/compare/route.ts
- Matches similar items between contractor and adjuster estimates
- Handles construction material and labor items
- Identifies equivalent items with different terminology
- Validates item relationships and dependencies
- Processes Xactimate/Symbility specific codes

3. Price Discrepancy Analysis
- Calculates variations in unit costs and quantities
- Implements industry-specific thresholds for price differences
- Flags significant deviations requiring review
- Handles construction measurement unit conversions

Key Business Rules:
- Items must match based on normalized construction terminology
- Price variations above threshold require additional validation
- Related construction items must be identified and grouped
- Industry-specific codes must be properly interpreted
- Measurement units must be standardized before comparison

The system focuses on construction domain expertise in estimate processing, emphasizing accurate matching of equivalent items despite terminology differences and proper handling of industry-specific pricing rules.
