# estimate-parsing-flow

The estimate parsing workflow consists of three main components that handle construction-specific document analysis and comparison:

## Construction Estimate Parser
Path: `/lib/estimate-parser.ts`
Importance Score: 85/100

- Specialized parsing for construction industry estimate formats:
  - Xactimate format parsing
  - Symbility format parsing
- Construction terminology normalization:
  - Standard measurements (sq ft, lf)
  - Common abbreviations (r&r)
  - Industry-specific terms
- Construction line item similarity matching:
  - Industry measurement type handling (area, linear, volume, count)

## Estimate Comparison Engine
Path: `/lib/estimate-comparison.ts`
Importance Score: 90/100

- Construction-specific line item matching using industry codes
- Industry threshold validations:
  - 25% threshold for quantity differences
  - 15% threshold for unit price variations
- Construction measurement conversions
- Cross-format estimate reconciliation

## AI Analysis Integration
Path: `/tools/estimate-comparison/index.tsx`
Importance Score: 80/100

- Construction-focused AI analysis workflow:
  - Adjuster vs contractor estimate processing
  - Industry-standard discrepancy categorization
  - Priority-based difference classification (critical/minor)
- Construction-specific metric reporting
- Industry-standard comparison documentation

The parsing flow implements specialized rules for handling construction industry documentation, with particular emphasis on terminology standardization and measurement handling across different estimate formats.
