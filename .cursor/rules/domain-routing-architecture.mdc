## Subdomain Routing Implementation
The system implements a specialized subdomain-based routing architecture for tool access and isolation:

### Core Routing Rules
- Tool-specific subdomains map directly to corresponding tool pages
- Automatic routing pattern: `/tools/${tool.id}`
- Reserved subdomains: 'www' and 'mannystoolbox' receive special handling
- Root paths on tool subdomains redirect to tool-specific pages

### Access Control Integration
- Subdomain validation enforces tool access permissions
- Prevents unauthorized access through URL manipulation
- Maintains strict separation between main domain and tool subdomains
- Environment-specific handling for development (localhost) vs production

### File Structure
Primary implementation: `/middleware.ts`

### Business Impact Score: 75/100
Rationale:
- Implements unique domain-specific routing architecture
- Controls tool access through subdomain validation
- Critical for tool isolation and security
- Moderate complexity focused on routing rules
