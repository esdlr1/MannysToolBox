# domain-routing-architecture

## Core Routing Implementation
- Tool-specific subdomains map directly to isolated tool environments
- Dynamic routing transforms root paths (/) on tool subdomains to `/tools/[toolId]`
- Enforces strict subdomain-tool relationship validation

## Access Control Rules
- Reserved domain protection for 'www' and 'mannystoolbox'
- Tool access permissions validated through subdomain-path matching
- Environment-aware URL generation for development vs production contexts

## Tool Isolation Strategy
Path: `app/tools/[toolId]/page.tsx`
- Dynamic tool access through dedicated subdomains
- Tool-specific access control enforcement
- Maintains tool isolation through subdomain boundaries

## Business Logic Score: 85/100
Domain-specific value:
- Enables construction tool isolation through subdomain architecture
- Enforces tool-specific access patterns
- Implements construction industry-specific routing rules
- Maintains tool relationship integrity through subdomain validation

The routing architecture specifically addresses construction industry needs by:
- Isolating specialized construction tools in dedicated environments
- Enforcing tool-specific access controls
- Managing environment-specific routing for development and production
- Maintaining consistent tool access patterns across the platform
