Subdomain-based Tool Access Control System
Importance Score: 65/100

Primary Component (middleware.ts):

Tool Isolation Architecture:
- Each business tool exists as an isolated instance on unique subdomains
- Maps specific tool IDs to dedicated subdomains
- Enforces strict 1:1 relationship between tools and their access points

Access Control Rules:
1. Primary Domain Exclusions
   - Blocks tool routing on main domains ('www', 'mannystoolbox')
   - Preserves root domain for central dashboard/navigation

2. Tool Access Validation
   - Validates subdomain matches against authorized tool mappings
   - Prevents cross-tool access through subdomain manipulation
   - Maintains tool isolation through routing boundaries

3. Environment-Specific Routing
   - Development: Allows localhost testing with simulated subdomains
   - Production: Enforces strict subdomain-based access control

The system implements a multi-tenant architecture where business tools maintain complete isolation through subdomain boundaries, supporting organizational requirements for segmented tool access and control.
