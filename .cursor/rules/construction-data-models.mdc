Core data structures for construction estimate analysis:

1. Estimate Comparison Models
Location: app/api/tools/estimate-comparison/compare/route.ts

Key Data Structures:
- Line Item Mapping
  - Industry-specific codes (Xactimate/Symbility)
  - Material quantities and units
  - Labor costs and time estimates
  - Room/location identifiers

- Price Discrepancy Tracking
  - Threshold definitions by material type
  - Variance calculations with industry tolerances
  - Historical price trend integration

2. Construction Terminology Matching
- Standard terminology mappings
  - "R&R" = "Remove and Replace"
  - Common material abbreviations
  - Unit conversion standards
  - Regional pricing variations

3. Room Classification Schema
- Standardized room naming conventions
- Room type categorization
- Area/scope definitions
- Material requirements by room type

Importance Score: 90/100
- Critical for accurate estimate comparison
- Industry-specific data relationships
- Core pricing model implementation
- Construction domain expertise encoding

The data models implement specialized construction industry knowledge through structured relationships between materials, labor, and pricing components, enabling accurate estimate comparisons and standardized terminology matching.
