## Core Data Structures

### Estimate Comparison Models
Path: app/api/tools/estimate-comparison/compare/route.ts

Construction estimate data models implement:
- Industry-specific code matching and normalization
- Line item comparison structures with construction terminology
- Percentage-based variance tracking for measurements and costs
- Critical difference classification based on industry thresholds

Key Components:
1. Line Item Structure
- Construction material codes
- Standardized measurement units
- Price variance tolerances
- Quantity comparison rules

2. Estimate Classification System
- Priority-based discrepancy tracking
- Construction terminology matching rules
- Material category organization
- Measurement unit conversions

Importance Score: 90/100

### Price Analysis Models
Path: lib/estimate-parser.ts

Specialized data structures for:
- Construction cost normalization
- Unit price comparison logic
- Material cost variance tracking
- Industry-standard measurement conversions

Key Features:
1. Price Comparison Framework
- Material cost baselines
- Regional price adjustments
- Bulk pricing rules
- Contractor markup tracking

2. Measurement Standards
- Construction industry units
- Conversion rate tables
- Quantity aggregation rules
- Material-specific measurement types

Importance Score: 85/100
