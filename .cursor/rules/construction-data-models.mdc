# construction-data-models

## Core Data Structures

### Estimate Comparison Models
- Industry-specific construction codes mapping system
- Measurement types: area, linear, volume, count
- Unit pricing thresholds (15% variance tolerance)
- Quantity comparison thresholds (25% variance tolerance)

### Normalized Construction Terms
- Standardized measurements (sq ft, lf, r&r)
- Material and labor cost segregation
- Construction terminology abbreviations
- Industry-standard unit conversions

### Estimate Format Models
- Xactimate format structure
- Symbility format structure
- Line item matching patterns
- Construction-specific similarity metrics

## Data Validation Rules

### Measurement Validation
- Construction industry measurement types
- Unit conversion rules
- Area calculation standardization
- Volume computation standards

### Price Comparison Logic
- Unit price variance thresholds
- Quantity difference tolerances
- Material cost segregation rules
- Labor rate standardization
