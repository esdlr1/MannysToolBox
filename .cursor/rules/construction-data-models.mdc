# construction-data-models

Core Data Model Components (Importance: 95/100):

1. Estimate Line Item Structure
- Industry-standard Xactimate code mapping
- Quantity measurements with unit conversions
- Multi-tier pricing models (retail, wholesale, negotiated)
- Room and category classifications
- Material grade specifications

2. Construction Dependencies Model
```typescript
interface ConstructionDependency {
  parentCode: string;
  requiredCodes: string[];
  conditions: DependencyCondition[];
  tradeCategory: TradeType;
}
```
Maps relationships between construction items, enforcing industry standards for:
- Material dependencies
- Labor requirements
- Trade-specific workflows
- Building code compliance

3. Damage Assessment Schema
- Water categories (1-3)
- Fire/smoke damage levels
- Storm impact classifications
- Room-by-room condition mapping
- Material replacement requirements

4. Measurement Standards
- Linear feet calculations
- Square footage conversions
- Volume measurements
- Height/depth specifications
- Industry-standard rounding rules

5. Price Comparison Models
- Regional price adjustments
- Material grade differentials
- Labor rate categories
- Markup calculations
- Bundle pricing rules

Integration Points:
- Xactimate code validation system
- TheClearScope damage assessment
- Industry certification requirements
- Building code compliance checks
