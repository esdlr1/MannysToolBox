Core Comparison Logic:
- Line item matching algorithm specialized for construction estimates
- Percentage-based discrepancy detection between estimate versions
- Classification system for critical vs minor cost differences
- Construction-specific terminology normalization and matching

Business Rules:
1. Item Matching
- Identifies matching line items between estimates using domain-specific similarity scoring
- Normalizes construction terminology and measurements for comparison
- Handles variations in item descriptions while maintaining semantic matching

2. Discrepancy Detection
- Calculates percentage differences in quantities and costs
- Classifies discrepancies based on industry-standard thresholds:
  - Critical: >10% difference in cost or quantity
  - Major: 5-10% difference
  - Minor: <5% difference

3. Domain-Specific Processing
- Construction unit conversions (e.g., square feet to square yards)
- Material cost variance analysis
- Labor rate comparison checks
- Equipment cost reconciliation

Importance Score: 90/100
The estimate comparison algorithm represents core business functionality specific to the construction industry, implementing specialized rules for cost analysis and estimate reconciliation.

Key Components:
- Construction terminology matching engine
- Industry-standard measurement normalization
- Cost variance prioritization system
- Automated discrepancy reporting logic
