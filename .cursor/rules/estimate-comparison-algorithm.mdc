Construction Estimate Comparison Core Logic:

1. Matching Rules
- Recognizes equivalent terminology (e.g., "R&R" = "Remove and Replace")
- Matches room names with variations ("Master Bath" = "Master Bathroom")
- Identifies related line items across different estimate formats
- Handles construction industry codes from Xactimate/Symbility systems

2. Threshold Configuration
- Price discrepancy tolerance levels by material type
- Square footage variation allowances for measurements
- Quantity difference thresholds based on item categories
- Critical vs. minor difference classification rules

3. Prioritization Logic
- High-value items flagged for priority review
- Missing dependent items highlighted (e.g., drywall requiring texture)
- Material-labor relationship validation
- Category-based comparison importance weighting

4. Business Rules
- Construction-specific terminology standardization
- Industry measurement unit conversions
- Price variation tolerances by material category
- Required vs. optional line item classification

Importance Score: 90/100
- Critical business algorithm for construction estimate reconciliation
- Highly specialized domain logic for construction industry
- Core revenue-impacting functionality
- Complex industry-specific matching requirements
