# estimate-comparison-algorithm

The estimate comparison system implements specialized construction industry logic for analyzing and comparing estimates across different formats:

## Core Matching Rules
- Line items matched using construction industry codes
- Construction terminology and abbreviations normalized (sq ft, lf, r&r)
- Industry-standard measurement types handled (area, linear, volume, count)
- Construction-specific similarity matching for line items

## Threshold Logic
- Quantity discrepancy threshold: 25%
- Unit price discrepancy threshold: 15%
- Handles construction-specific measurements and unit conversions

## Prioritization System
- Categorizes discrepancies as critical or minor based on industry thresholds
- Implements specialized rules for identifying missing items
- Prioritizes measurement and cost differences according to construction standards

## Key Components
