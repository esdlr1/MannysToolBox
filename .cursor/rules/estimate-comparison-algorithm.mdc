# estimate-comparison-algorithm

The estimate comparison system implements specialized construction industry matching and analysis logic:

Core Components:

1. Line Item Matching Engine
Path: lib/estimate-comparison.ts
- Construction-specific code and terminology matching
- Specialized comparison rules for materials and labor items
- Multi-level confidence scoring based on:
  * Exact code matches
  * Description similarity
  * Unit price variance
  * Quantity alignment
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Construction Dependencies Analysis
Path: lib/estimate-dependencies.ts
- Validates related item presence across estimates
- Enforces construction industry standard relationships
- Maps dependencies between materials and labor codes
- Flags missing dependent items with severity levels
Importance Score: 90/100

3. Estimate Variance Analysis
Path: types/estimate-comparison.ts
- Price deviation thresholds by item category
- Quantity mismatch tolerance rules
- Classification system for discrepancies:
  * Critical variations
  * Standard variations
  * Acceptable differences
Importance Score: 85/100

Key Domain Rules:
- Construction code normalization for cross-system comparison
- Industry-specific unit price variance tolerances
- Material/labor relationship validation
- Specialized matching rules for construction terminology

The algorithm prioritizes:
1. Direct construction code matches
2. Related item completeness
3. Industry-standard price variances
4. Required dependencies presence
